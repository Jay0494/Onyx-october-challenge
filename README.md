### Analysis of Employee Satisfaction and Performance at "Onyx Corp"
### Project Introduction: Employee Satisfaction and Performance Analysis at Onyx Corp

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of employee satisfaction and performance at Onyx Corp, a fictional organization. The goal was to gain insights into employee morale, departmental performance, turnover trends, and demographic distribution, ultimately helping the company to make data-driven decisions that could enhance employee retention, job satisfaction, and productivity.

#### Key Steps in the Project:
1. **Data Cleaning with Power Query**: 
   - Raw data often contains inconsistencies and redundancies, which can obscure valuable insights. Using Power Query, I thoroughly cleaned the data by addressing missing values, normalizing entries, and standardizing formats across different datasets. This step was crucial for ensuring accuracy and consistency in the analysis.

2. **Data Visualization with Power BI**:
   - I used Power BI to create intuitive, interactive dashboards that visualize various aspects of employee satisfaction and performance. These visuals include trend charts for annual satisfaction and performance scores, turnover rates by department and gender, and performance comparisons across job roles and tenure levels. The dashboards enable stakeholders to explore the data dynamically, identify key trends, and make targeted recommendations based on clear, data-driven insights.

Through this analysis, I have provided Onyx Corp with actionable insights into workforce dynamics, with a focus on enhancing both employee experience and organizational performance.

#### 1. **Employee Satisfaction**
   - **Annual Satisfaction Trends**: Satisfaction scores have hovered around 3.0 over the years with minor fluctuations, peaking slightly in 2016 and 2019, but mostly staying consistent. This suggests a steady but possibly lukewarm sentiment among employees without notable improvements.
   - **Satisfaction by Job Title**: Specialists reported the highest total satisfaction scores, while roles like Engineers and Developers showed slightly lower scores, potentially indicating differences in job-specific experiences.
   - **Turnover Rate and Satisfaction**: The companyâ€™s turnover rate is about 10.01%, with slight variation across departments. Notably, high turnover can be an indicator of underlying dissatisfaction or unmet employee expectations in some departments.

#### 2. **Employee Performance**
   - **Annual Performance Scores**: The annual average performance scores also average around 3.0, with only minor deviations across years, showing that while employees maintain consistent performance, there has been little notable improvement.
   - **Performance by Department**: Engineering, Operations, and IT departments showed slightly higher average performance scores, while departments such as Finance, Marketing, and Legal had lower scores. This could reflect specific departmental challenges or resource allocations impacting performance.
   - **Performance by Tenure**: Performance scores were highest among long-term employees, likely due to experience, while new hires showed comparatively lower scores. This reflects a potential onboarding or adjustment challenge that impacts new hires.

#### 3. **Demographic Insights**
   - **Gender Distribution**: The workforce is nearly balanced with 48% male and 48% female, with a small percentage (4%) identifying as another gender. Turnover and performance metrics do not show significant gender-based differences, indicating a potentially inclusive culture.
   - **Absentee Rate**: With an absentee rate of 0.53%, Onyx Corp seems to have fairly reliable attendance, suggesting a reasonably committed workforce.

### Recommendations for Onyx Corp
1. **Enhance Job Satisfaction Programs**: Given the steady but unimproved satisfaction scores, consider conducting in-depth surveys or focus groups to understand what could elevate satisfaction, especially among lower-scoring departments and roles like Engineers and Developers.
   
2. **Address Departmental Disparities**: Departments like Finance, Legal, and Marketing show lower average performance scores. Onyx Corp should consider departmental audits to identify if specific challenges (e.g., resource limitations or process inefficiencies) are impacting productivity.

3. **Strengthen Onboarding for New Hires**: Since new hires show lower performance scores, consider implementing enhanced onboarding and mentorship programs to accelerate their adjustment and productivity.

4. **Reduce Turnover in High-Turnover Departments**: Finance, HR, and Legal show slightly higher turnover. Addressing turnover could involve career development programs, clearer growth pathways, or role-specific wellness initiatives to retain talent.

5. **Track Satisfaction Changes with New Initiatives**: Any new initiatives should be tracked with satisfaction and performance metrics over time to ensure they yield improvements in both areas.
